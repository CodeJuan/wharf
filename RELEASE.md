# RELEASE

Wharf is a successor of ContainerOps platform whose concept is built upon the DevOps, which means it's a higher level solution over traditional approach and DevOps, but not an alternative. The ultimate goal of Wharf is building a pipeline form development to deployment & operations through Docker, Rocket and other container solutions.

ContainerOps is all about product workflow. Wharf builds and runs a container image you defined whenever new code is being pushed, along with corresponding dependence system. But it's not all, the image will also work with continuous integration, or continuous deployment with Rocket, LXC or Atomic, etc. Wharf is focusing on the continuous changes from version control system to production environment.

Now, it's time to announce our pre-release and core of ContainerOps version of Wharf, you can replace Docker Registry with it. Please make sure you know that Wharf is currently under alpha stage.

Our team is still working really hard for your happiness with the complete version of ContainerOps platform, which comes in next few months.
