RELEASE
=============

Wharf is a ContainerOps platform which is the next generation DevOps, never meant to replace the DevOps or traditional approach. The wharf’s goal is building a pipeline with Docker, Rocket and other containers from development to deployment & operations. ContainerOps is all about the change process. When you push commit to the version control system, the Wharf will build a container image included run codes with dependence system automatically. Then the image could be used in continuous integration or continuous deployment with Rocket, LXC or Atomic. We are focusing on continuous changes from version control system to production. 

Now we are pre-releasing early version of Wharf, it’s an alternative Docker Registry for just now. It will be core of our ContainerOps vision. We are working hard for more fearless and will assemble the whole ContainerOps platform in the next months.
This is early alpha stuff, you’ve been warned.
